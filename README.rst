Fledge alexa notification delivery plugin
==========================================

A simple Alexa notification delivery plugin that uses the Alexa NotifyMe skill.

Enable the NotifyMe skill on your Amazon Alexa device. Link this skill to you Amazon
account so that NotifyMe will send you an access code that is required to configure
this plugin.

When you receive a notification Alexa will make a noise to say you have a new notification
and the green light on your Echo device will light to say you have waiting notifications.

To hear your notifications simply say "Alexa, read my notifications"


Build
-----
To build Fledge "alexa notification" C++ plugin:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ./requirements.sh
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

- By default the Fledge develop package header files and libraries
  are expected to be located in /usr/include/fledge and /usr/lib/fledge
- If **FLEDGE_ROOT** env var is set and no -D options are set,
  the header files and libraries paths are pulled from the ones under the
  FLEDGE_ROOT directory.
  Please note that you must first run 'make' in the FLEDGE_ROOT directory.

You may also pass one or more of the following options to cmake to override 
this default behaviour:

- **FLEDGE_SRC** sets the path of a Fledge source tree
- **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** sets the path to Fledge header files
- **FLEDGE_LIB sets** the path to Fledge libraries
- **FLEDGE_INSTALL** sets the installation path of Random plugin

NOTE:
 - The **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** option should point to a location where all the Fledge 
   header files have been installed in a single directory.
 - The **FLEDGE_LIB** option should point to a location where all the Fledge
   libraries have been installed in a single directory.
 - 'make install' target is defined only when **FLEDGE_INSTALL** is set

Examples:

- no options

  $ cmake ..

- no options and FLEDGE_ROOT set

  $ export FLEDGE_ROOT=/some_fledge_setup

  $ cmake ..

- set FLEDGE_SRC

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_SRC=/home/source/develop/Fledge  ..

- set FLEDGE_INCLUDE

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INCLUDE=/dev-package/include ..
- set FLEDGE_LIB

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_LIB=/home/dev/package/lib ..
- set FLEDGE_INSTALL

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/home/source/develop/Fledge ..

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/usr/local/fledge ..
